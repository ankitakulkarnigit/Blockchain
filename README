Project 3: BlockChain

In this project we implemented a node thatâ€™s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus protocol. Our code will receive incoming transactions and blocks and maintain an updated block chain.

Files provided:
1. Block.java - Stores the block data structure.
2. BlockHandler.java - Uses BlockChain.java to process a newly received block, create a new block, or process a newly received transaction.
3. ByteArrayWrapper.java - A utility file which creates a wrapper for byte arrays such that it could be used as a key in hash functions. (See TransactionPool.java )
4. Transaction.java - This is similar to Transaction.java as provided in Project 1 (https://github.com/ankitakulkarnigit/ScroogeCoin) except for introducing functionality to create a coinbase transaction. Take a look at Block.java constructor to see how a coinbase transaction is created.
5. TransactionPool.java - Implements a pool of transactions, required when creating a new block.
6. UTXO.java From Project 1 (https://github.com/ankitakulkarnigit/ScroogeCoin).
7. UTXOPool.java From Project 1 (https://github.com/ankitakulkarnigit/ScroogeCoin).
